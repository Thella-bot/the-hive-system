A culinary institute Hive built with Laravel, Inertia.js, and Vue 3. The Hive is an all-in-one internal platform for managing the academic, administrative, and social life of a culinary school — from student enrolment and cohort management to course delivery, assessments, and staff engagement.

## Key Design Decisions

**No Jetstream Teams** — Jetstream is used for authentication only. Department and cohort structure is managed through custom models rather than Jetstream's team system, giving us full control over the school hierarchy.

**Dual profile system** — Users have either a `StaffProfile` or a `StudentProfile` depending on their role. This keeps role-specific fields clean and separate without overloading the `users` table.

**Permission-driven UI** — The sidebar, action buttons, and page access are all driven by Spatie permissions shared via `HandleInertiaRequests`. Adding a permission to a role in the seeder automatically surfaces the relevant UI to that role.

**Soft deletes on key models** — Departments, cohorts, and student profiles use soft deletes so historical records are preserved even after removal.
